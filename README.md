# Satellite Visualization Toy

This is a mash up of various satellite and geo map related d3 demos. The base is adapted from [Satellite Ground Tracks](https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/6c149c08fc9cde682635). That example uses [satellite.js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) to do all the heavy lifting of orbital mechanics and satellite tracking. That library is itself a Javascript translation of a [SGP4 implementation in Python](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/).

Satellite footprints are loosely adapted from [this example](https://bl.ocks.org/tuckergordon/ce135a88cd14991761ccdc937179c6c0).
